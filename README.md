# palmprint recognition
This is a preliminary project conducted during my AI learning journey, under the guidance of Professor Jizhao Liu. We successfully performed classification using PCA+KNN/SVM on a dataset containing both Hong Kong Polytechnic University data and my own palm data. The code was executed on Colab, and the final code can be found in the 'final.ipynb' file. It encompasses feature extraction, training, and final testing, excluding the initial data preprocessing.

There are 101 objects in this dataset, each object has 6 images, of which the first 5 are used for training and testing, i.e., a total of 606 images, and the last 1 image (101 images in total) is used for final training. It takes about 1 minute of training time in colab's tpu environment.

Since most of the files are larger than 25M in size, it is not easy to show on Git Hub, visit my [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yfT0I9lCGvcaNuiCcEzSNtlbPGl-NzZa?) to view the dataset and code.
